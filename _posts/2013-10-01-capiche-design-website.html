<p>One of my first jobs upon joining the ranks at Capiche Design was to look into how we can best showcase our own work online.</p>

<p>After much research we decided that a picture does indeed tell a thousand words, so we should keep it as visual as possible. The site was also to be as flexible as possible across a range of tablet and mobile devices.</p>

<p>The site frontend is built on the popular <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> framework to allow for best device compatibility and a more streamlined development. There are also a number of additions to this including an animated grid system on the home page to animate and filter our portfolio, and also a fullscreen carousel to showcase each project.</p>

<p>The site backend is also built by us, using the great Kiwi CMS <a title="Silverstripe CMS" href="http://www.silverstripe.org" target="_blank">Silverstripe</a>, with extended functionality including server-side adaptive images to deliver optimum image sizes to each device and minimise bandwidth used.</p>
