A test of the capabilities of the Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP) for the New Zealand Business Number as a viable animated GIF replacement.

The [NZBN website](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/) currently uses an animated GIF on its homepage showing an actual New Zealand Business Number animating to become the NZBN logo. This test uses multiple Greensock timelines running in parallel to reproduce a similar sequence.
