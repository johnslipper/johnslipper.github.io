<p><a title="Total Property Soltutions" href="http://totalproperty.net.nz" target="_blank">Total Property Solutions</a>Â wanted a website that efficiently communicated their company in a single page.</p>

<p>My role in this project also extended from development to also include the design and also photography of the main header shot. Also included is a custom JavaScript based highlight system to focus the page on the required information.
