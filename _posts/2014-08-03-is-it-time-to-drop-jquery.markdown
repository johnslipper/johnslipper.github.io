With the slow but steady rise of Web Components & Web Standards, isn't is about time you started to learn vanilla JavaScript and stop relying on JQuery?

I have to say I'm firmly in the camp of yes. Don't get me wrong, I can see myself using JQuery in projects for some time to come while it fits the spec. It is of course always a good idea to have an understanding of the underlying workings of JQuery and prepare for a future where it is no longer needed. This post by [Todd Motto](http://toddmotto.com "Visit Todd's website") shows vanilla alternatives to JQuery code a lot of us use regularly and is well worth the read.
