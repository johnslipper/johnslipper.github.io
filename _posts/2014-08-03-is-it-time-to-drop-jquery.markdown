With the slow but steady rise of Web Components & standards, isn't is about time you started to learn vanilla JavaScript and stop relying on JQuery?

I have to say I'm firmly in the camp of yes. Don't get me wrong, I can see myself using JQuery in projects for some time to come if it fits the spec, but it's always good to have an understanding of the underlying workings of JQuery and prepare for a future where it is no longer needed. This post shows vanilla alternatives to JQuery code a lot of us use regularly and is well worth the read.
