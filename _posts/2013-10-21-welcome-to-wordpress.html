<p>I'm pretty new to Wordpress; I know what you're going to say... "How come your only just using Wordpress, you're a web developer right?"</p>

<p>Well the answer to the above question is yes I am a web developer, but I have never found the time to actually develop my own site.</p>

<p>I have used Wordpress before but only with really pre-made templates, so this time I thought I'd start from scratch and build a template from the ground up. It also seemed like an ideal time to get familiar with <a title="Compass CSS Framework" href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> and <a title="Bourbon - a sass mixin library" href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a>.</p>

<p>In the past I have taken to making my own sites static, with the goal to get them 100% perfect before launch. The reasoning behind it being that my own website should reflect the quality of work I do on a day-to-day basis. In recent years browsers have leapt forward in features and capability to such a degree that keeping up with the latest tech is now a full-time job in itself!</p>

<p><img title="Website responsive phone layout" alt="Website responsive phone layout" src="/img/posts-full/johnslipper-wordpress-phone.jpg" /></p>

<p>With that in mind I am now changing my approach to thinking of my own site as more of a continuing work in progress; a sort of scratch pad for experimenting with new ideas. Along with that approach I am also using a CMS, in this case Wordpress, to post regularly and become a more active member of the web development community.</p>

<p>The responsive design has been in the works for a long time (I wouldn't say I've spent a long time actually on it though!), it is a little experimental and any feedback is appreciated.</p>

<p>I have avoided targeting the responsive design at specific device sizes that date quickly as technology progresses. Instead I have added breakpoints to the design at intelligent widths that compliment the content and optimise the layout regardless of device type (from mobile to large desktops).</p>

<p>I am writing this on my development server on a working template, which I plan to go live with shortly. Although it is still in it's infancy, I will be improving and enhancing the design over time, maybe even adding full Internet Explorer 8 support! (definitely maybe on that one).</p>
