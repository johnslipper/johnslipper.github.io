Here's a little bit of peel-able fun I had whilst learning how to use the excellent [skrollr](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/ "Skrollr JavaScript library") JavaScript library.

The idea was to try and replicate the way a sticker peels of a surface. Searching the interwebs I found [this sticker example](http://codepen.io/patrickkunka/pen/axEgL "CSS3 based peeling sticker CodePen demo") which mimicked the type of animation I had imagined, so I based my version on a similar structure. I then adapted it instead to leverage the scrolling power of skrollr and gave it a new context.
