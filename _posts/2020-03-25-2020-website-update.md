After 5 years I thought it was time to re-think and completely refresh the site.

A lot has changed in browsers over the last 5 years and they are much more capable because of it. The idea of this 2020 update was to try to utilise some of the newer browser features, not as gimmicks, but rather for efficiency, performance and most of all to aid all site users.

New features:

-   Significantly lower footprint (CSS 17KB uncompressed / 167B compressed)
-   Automatic dark theme (OS preference by default but can also be set by user)
-   Better support for larger monitors with font scaling
-   Accessible colour contrasts
-   Better support for screen readers (ongoing)
-   Support for reduced motion CSS
