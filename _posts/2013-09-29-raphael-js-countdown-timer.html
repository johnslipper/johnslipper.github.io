<p>During work on the <a title="Stroke Wise Quiz" href="http://johnslipper.com/stroke-wise-quiz/">Stroke Wise</a> online quiz I had to research methods of creating a circular countdown timer.</p>

<p>The timer had to also support legacy versions of Internet Explorer back as far as 8 so I decided <a title="Raphaël JS" href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphaël JS</a> was the most obvious choice as it both uses newer SVG markup for modern browsers while also providing legacy Internet Explorer support through their proprietary <a title="Microsoft VML" href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language">VML</a> engine.</p>

<p class="text-center"><a href="http://demos.johnslipper.com/raphael-js-countdown-timer/" title="Open demo"><img src="/img/posts-full/countdown-demo.jpg" alt="Image of countdown demo" style="width: 260px;"></a></p>

<p>This demo shows how a simple countdown timer can be implemented, including a button to increment the time as it is counting down.</p>
