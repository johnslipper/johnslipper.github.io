<p>Prior to my move to New Zealand I worked for a company called <a title="Trackyou Asset Tracking" href="https://trackyou.co.uk/" target="_blank">Trackyou</a>Â that specialise in real-time vehicle tracking and asset management.</p>

<p>One of my responsibilities during my time at Trackyou was the creation and management of their marketing website. Built on Joomla! with a custom themed template and extended with 3rd party modules as required during my time in the company.</p>
