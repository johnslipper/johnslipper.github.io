<div class="post__update">
    <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The business has since been sold and the web app
    taken offline.
</div>

<p>
    Alongside the development of
    <a title="The Ironworks Website" href="/the-ironworks-website/"
        >The Ironwork's website</a
    >
    I decided to create a web app for iPhone to display a feed of the latest
    events.
</p>

<p>
    The app can be added to the home screen to quickly access events on the
    move. The app uses the events RSS feed from the main website, and displays
    the content in a mobile friendly way. This means that the app is
    automatically kept up to date when the main website is.
