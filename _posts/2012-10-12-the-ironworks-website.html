<p>
    Some years before my move to NZ I worked on a website for a local
    entertainment venue called The Ironworks.
</p>

<p>
    The site was based on the
    <a
        title="Joomla! CMS"
        href="http://www.joomla.org/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
        >Joomla!</a
    >
    CMS using a custom designed theme, and extended using 3rd party modules to
    advertise a feed of upcoming events and ticket purchasing.
</p>
