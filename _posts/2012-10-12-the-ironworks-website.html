<p>Some years before my move to NZ I worked on a website for a local entertainment venue called <a title="The Ironworks" href="http://the-ironworks.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Ironworks</a>.</p>

<p>The site was based on the <a title="Joomla! CMS" href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla!</a> CMS using a custom designed theme, and extended using 3rd party modules to advertise a feed of upcoming events and ticket purchasing.</p>

<div class="panel callout"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The business has since been sold and the website taken down.</p></div>
