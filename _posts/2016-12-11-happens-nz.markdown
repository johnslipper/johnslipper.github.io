A project by [Capiche Design](http://capiche.co.nz) for the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management to help prepare New Zealanders for emergency situations.

Includes an AngularJS app to create a personal plan of what to do in the event of an emergency and people that need to be contacted.
