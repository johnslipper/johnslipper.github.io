<p>
    Mobile website development, utilising GPS location to find nearby VTNZ
    services.
</p>

<p>
    At Capiche we were given the opportunity to design and develop the frontend
    for their national mobile website. Our focus was on getting an intuitive and
    highly optimised experience that utilised modern smart phoneÂ technologies
    such as GPS location and CSS3 support.
</p>

<p>
    To approach this project we asked VTNZ to first prioritise the features from
    their desktop website that were both popular and useful to customers on the
    move. We could then avoid cluttering the website with unnecessary
    information and focus on getting an efficient experience for the important
    areas.
</p>

<p>
    The finish website uses CSS3 and sprites to minimise the amount of images
    used across the site, speed up loading and minimise mobile data usage.
