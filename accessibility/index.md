# Accessibility statement

I’d like this website to be usable by the widest possible audience, regardless of device, browser, network speed, or ability. As such, this website strives to meet the level AA standards outlined in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

This page attempts to describe the current state of this website’s accessibility features. If you have any trouble accessing any part of this website, please feel free to email me. I take accessibility-related issues very seriously, and I’ll try to correct the issue as soon as I can. I will also keep this document up-to-date as the website changes.

## Accessibility features

Pages are structured with semantic elements like **header**, **navigation**, **main**, and **footer**, which may help you move around more quickly. Headings at level 1 mark the main content area of each page, and each page’s structure should follow a logical heading order from there. Each page on this website has a “skip to main content” link at the top, and a “back to start” link at the very bottom.

Images are described with text equivalents, to ensure everyone can access graphical content. You should be able to zoom each page up to 300% without any issues.

This website’s colors were chosen to ensure there is sufficient color contrast on each page. Every component of this website is accessible via mouse, keyboard, or touch. To ensure the website is usable by keyboards, I’ve added focus styles to focusable elements.

This website has been tested on modern browsers and has had basic screen reader testing in Safari with VoiceOver so far.

## Known issues

### Article list hero images

These are currently hidden from screen readers due to the repeated anchor link from the heading and also lacking alternative descriptive text at this point (Did not consider them in the past).

### Further screen reader testing

In addition to testing in Safari using VoiceOver I also want to spend time with other browsers and screen readers such as Chrome with ChromeVox on desktop and both android and iOS readers.

## Send me feedback

I care deeply about accessibility, but I’m always learning more about it. If you have any issues using any part of this website, please do contact me. I would welcome your feedback or suggestions.
